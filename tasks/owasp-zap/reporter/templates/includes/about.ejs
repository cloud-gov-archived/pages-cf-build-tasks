    About this scan
  </h2>
  <p>According to <a class="usa-link"

    target="_blank">OMB Memo 23-22</a>, agencies should follow and automate security best practices to ensure security is considered throughout all stages of the design and development lifecycle. OMB further directs agencies to  conduct regular security assessments when developing software or websites. Specifically, agencies should regularly assess the potential impact of a security incident on vital transactions or core services provided to the public, access to timely information, government and vital external operations, and public trust. <b>In addition to automated security scanning, agencies should perform manual penetration testing,</b> where appropriate, based on threat analysis and the criticality of the underlying system.</p>   
    <p>This scan uses the open source penetration testing tool Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP). The <a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/docker/baseline-scan/" target="_blank" class="usa-link">ZAP Baseline security scan</a> passively scans your published website for common security vulnerabilities, but does not perform any attack or attempt to maliciously modify your site code. This scan may find evidence of issues such as the unintended exposure of sensitive data, SQL injection opportunities, cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws, and the use of components with known vulnerabilities.
