# axe-reporter-html

[Forked from `axe-reporter-html`](https://github.com/Widen/axe-reporter-html/)

Creates an HTML report from Axe results listing violations, passes, incomplete
and incompatible results.

Given a JSON file in a `/results` directory, the following command creates matching HTML reports in `/_sites`.

```sh

node index.js

```
